### Sample work for cmc top gainers

So this is a sample work that I created to show a client as part of my proposal. 
This is meant to scrape a url for top crypto gainers at regular intervals and send notifications.

I like to complete something once I start it, that's why I went ahead to do the project anyway, 
so I might be uploading the full code here if the client does not accept my proposal when I am sure the task is compeleted (Of course I will remove detailed client specs).
